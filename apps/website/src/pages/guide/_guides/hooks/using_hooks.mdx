# Using hooks

Discord-Player has a lot of useful hooks, that can be used anywhere once the Player has been initialized.

Here are few examples on how to use them :

# General Hooks

These hooks provide access to the player instance, queue, history, metadata, timeline, player node, etc. There are two ways to use these hooks:

1. **Using the hooks with `NodeResolvable` argument**: This mode allows you to use hooks anywhere by providing node resolvable as an argument (like guild object or guild id, etc.). An example of this is shown below:

```js
const { useQueue } = require('discord-player');

// your command
export async function execute(interaction) {
    // here we are passing the guild id as an argument
    const queue = useQueue(interaction.guild.id);
}
```

2. **Using the hooks without arguments**: This mode allows you to use hooks only inside the `HooksContextProvider`. This is useful when you want to use hooks in the command handler or similar places without having to pass the node resolvable every time. An example of this is shown below:

First of all, your command handler needs to provide context to `HooksContextProvider`:

```js
const { withContext } = require('discord-player');

client.on('interactionCreate', async (interaction) => {
    if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

    // assuming the following code is your target command to be executed
    const command = getCommandSomehow(); // shape is roughly { execute: Function }

    const context = { guild: interaction.guild };

    // provide context and execute the command
    await withContext(context, () => command.execute(interaction));
});
```

```js
const { useQueue } = require('discord-player');

// your command
export async function execute(interaction) {
    // here we are not passing any arguments, discord-player will automatically resolve correct queue based on the context
    const queue = useQueue();
}
```

## useMainPlayer (Fetch the player instance)

```js
const { useMainPlayer } = require("discord-player");
...
const player = useMainPlayer();
```

## usePlayer (Fetch the GuildQueuePlayerNode)

_You can find all the properties and methods of GuildQueuePlayerNode [here](https://discord-player.js.org/docs/discord-player/class/GuildQueuePlayerNode)_

```js
const { usePlayer } = require("discord-player");
...
const guildNode = usePlayer(interaction.guild.id);
const progressBar = guildNode.createProgressBar(); // Create a progress bar string
const progressPercentage = guildNode.getTimestamp(); // Get the current track progress in %
...
```

## useQueue (Fetch the guild queue)

```js
const { useQueue } = require("discord-player");
...
const queue = useQueue(interaction.guild.id);
```

## useHistory (Fetch the guild queue history)

```js
const { useHistory } = require("discord-player");
...
const history = useHistory(interaction.guild.id);
```

## useMetadata (Manipulate the queue metadata)

```js
const { useMetadata } = require("discord-player");
...
const [getMetadata, setMetadata] = useMetadata(interaction.guild.id);
let currentMetadata = getMetadata(); // We can fetch the metadata using the getter
setMetadata(interaction.channel); // We can set the metadata using the setter
```

_You can also set the metadata while executing the play command. Check the example below._

```js
await player.play(channel, query, {
    nodeOptions: {
        metadata: interaction.channel
    }
});
```

## useTimeline (Fetch/Manipulate the current track in queue)

```js
const { useTimeline } = require("discord-player");
...
const { timestamp, volume, paused, pause, resume, setVolume, setPosition, track } = useTimeline(interaction.guildId);

// `timestamp` returns the progress in %, current time stamp & total time stamp in both mins:secs / ms
interaction.reply(`Current progress : (${timestamp.current.label} / ${timestamp.total.label}) : ${timestamp.progress}%`)

// `volume` returns the current volume value
interaction.reply(`Current volume : ${volume}`)

// `paused` returns the current pause state of player
interaction.reply(`Player paused : ${paused}`)

// `pause()` will pause the player
pause();

// `resume();` will resume the player
resume();

// `setVolume()` sets the volume
setVolume(200);

// `setPosition()` seeks the current track. Takes timestamp in ms as input.
await setPosition(18400);
```

# Stream Hooks

Stream hooks are middleware which has the ability to modify the streaming behavior. There are two types of stream hooks in Discord Player:

### onBeforeCreateStream

Discord Player by default uses registered extractors to stream audio. If you need to override what needs to be streamed, you can use this hook.

> Sample Use Case : If you have local files for commonly played songs, then you can use `onBeforeCreateStream` to use the local file rather than fetching it from some online source.

```js
const { onBeforeCreateStream } = require("discord-player");
const fs = require('fs');
const queue = player.nodes.create(..., {
    ...,
    async onBeforeCreateStream(track, source, _queue) {
        if (track.title === 'some title') {
            return fs.createReadStream('./playThisInstead.mp3');
        }
    }
});
```

`<GuildQueue>.onBeforeCreateStream` is called before actually downloading the stream. It is a different concept from extractors, where you are **just** downloading
streams. `source` here will be a track source. Streams from `onBeforeCreateStream` are then piped to `FFmpeg` and sent to `onAfterCreateStream` hook.

### onAfterCreateStream

This hook can be used to post-process pcm stream. This is the final step before creating audio resource. Example:

```js
const { onAfterCreateStream } = require("discord-player");
const queue = player.nodes.create(..., {
    ...,
    async onAfterCreateStream(pcmStream, queue) {
        const encoder = new OpusEncoder();
        return {
            stream: encoder.encode(pcmStream),
            type: StreamType.Opus
        };
    }
});
```
